    <h2>Signature Therapeutic Massages</h2>
    
    <h3>Best Couples Massage in Winnipeg</h3>
    <p>Reconnect with your partner in our serene, private suite. Our <strong>couples massage</strong> is designed to synchronize relaxation for two, helping to lower stress hormones and improve emotional connection. It is an ideal gift for anniversaries or a needed escape from the weekly grind.</p>

    <h3>Hot Stone Massage</h3>
    <p>The <strong>hot stone massage</strong> at SPA OJAS utilizes smooth, heated basalt stones to deliver deep, penetrating warmth to your muscle tissues. This treatment is highly effective for loosening stiff joints and improving circulation, especially during Winnipeg’s colder months. The weight and heat of the stones ground the nervous system, providing a level of relaxation that manual massage alone cannot achieve.</p>

    <h3>Acupressure Massage</h3>
    <p>For a focused, revitalizing experience, our <strong>acupressure massage</strong> targets specific points along the body's meridians. This needle-free technique helps release muscular tension, boosts the immune system, and promotes mental clarity by clearing energetic blockages.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>How do I claim my acupuncture treatment on insurance?</h3>
    <p>After your session at SPA OJAS, we will issue an <strong>official receipt</strong> containing all necessary information (Practitioner Name, Registration Number, and Treatment Details). You can then submit this receipt to your insurance company via their mobile app or website for reimbursement.</p>
    
    <h3>What should I expect during a Face Rejuvenation Massage?</h3>
    <p>This treatment involves rhythmic, lifting strokes that stimulate lymphatic drainage and blood flow. It is non-invasive and provides an immediate "lifted" look, making it a favorite for clients preparing for special events.</p>

    <h3>Is the Hot Stone massage painful?</h3>
    <p>Not at all. The stones are heated to a comfortable, therapeutic temperature. Your therapist will always check with you to ensure the heat level is perfect for your skin sensitivity.</p>
